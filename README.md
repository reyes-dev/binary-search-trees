# binary-search-trees
A simple driver script should be able to do the following: 
1. Create a binary search tree from an array of random numbers (Array.new(15) { rand(1..100) })
2. Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling #balanced?
3. Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
4. Unbalance the tree by adding several numbers > 100
5. Confirm that the tree is unbalanced by calling #balanced?
6. Balance the tree by calling #rebalance
7. Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling #balanced?
8. Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
